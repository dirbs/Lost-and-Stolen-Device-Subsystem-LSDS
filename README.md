### Lost & Stolen Device Subsystem (LSDS)
Lost & Stolen Device Subsystem (LSDS) that is part of the Device Identification,
Registration and Blocking (DIRBS) system.


##### Directory structure

This repository contains code for **LSDS** part of the **DIRBS**. It contains

* ``app/`` -- The LSDS core server app, to be used as LSDS Web Server including database models, apis and resources
* ``etc/`` -- Config files etc to be reside here
* ``mock/`` -- Sample data files etc which are used in app to be reside here
* ``tests/`` -- Unit test scripts and Data

##### Prerequisites
In order to run a development environment, [Python 3.0+](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and 
[Postgresql10](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1786/) we assume that these are installed.

We also assume that this repo is cloned from Github onto the local computer, it is assumed that 
all commands mentioned in this guide are run from root directory of the project and inside
```virtual environment```

On Windows, we assume that a Bash like shell is available (i.e Bash under Cygwin), with GNU make installed.

##### Starting a dev environment
The easiest and quickest way to get started is to use local-only environment (i.e everything runs locally, including
Postgresql Server). To setup the local environment, follow the section below:

##### Setting up local dev environment
For setting up a local dev environment we assume that the ```prerequisites``` are met already. To setup a local 
environment:
* Create database using Postgresql (Name and credentials should be same as in [config](mock/test-config.ini))
* Create virtual environment using **virtualenv** and activate it:
```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Install the project requirements
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Start LSDS development server using:
```bash
python run.py
```

* Create migration repository 	
```bash
$ python manage.py db init
```

* Generate initial migration	
```bash
$ python manage.py db migrate
```

* Apply migrations to the database
```bash
$ python manage.py db upgrade
```

* Create function and trigger in db
```bash
$ python manage.py DbTrigger 
```

* Create view in db for search
```bash
$ python manage.py CreateView
```

* Seed data in db
```bash
$ python manage.py Seed
```

**Note:** After making changes in the schema only run step 2 and 3.

* To run unit tests, run
```bash
$ python -m unittest tests/main.py
```
